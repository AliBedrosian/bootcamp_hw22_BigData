Alison McCondichie - Homework 22 - Big Data Challenge - Home Sales

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate knowledge of Spark to analyze a dataframe of home sales information. SparkSQL queries were used to select and display aggregations on the data to answer specific questions about trends in home sales. Spark was also used to partition the data and cache the data table. The same query was used to test the run time of cached vs uncached tables and partitioned vs not partitioned data. In this example, the cached table ran the quickest.
